This is my final project for the "Mobile Application & Development" course. This project utilizes Flutter as the framework. Essentially, it is a to-do application that allows users to note their tasks, which are then stored in the database. I am using Firebase from Google for the database.

For simplicity, I used Android Studio as my virtual device.
